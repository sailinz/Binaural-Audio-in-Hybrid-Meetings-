# Binaural Audio in Hybrid Meetings
This repository contains files created and used for Loïc Rosset's Master Thesis: Advancing the User Experience of Hybrid Meetings with Binaural Audio (2021) and the extended work from the co-authors from the related papers.

The folders 1 to 3 contains all the materials used in the user study and consequent data analysis. The content of the folders are described here:

## Folder 1 : Dialogs
* Different files used for the recording of the dialogs. [/Experiment instructures/Dialogues X_xxx.pdf and procedure_enregistrements.docx]
* The transcription of the dialogs [/Experiment instructures/Dialogues_transcription.pdf]
* The timestampped events of the dialogs (including the sound directions) [event_timestamp].
* The timestampped events of the dialogs (including the sound directions of peudo sound when it was binaural-with-head-rotation format) [event_timestamp_new].
* The timestampped speech acts of the dialogs [speaker_events]

## Folder 2 : The videos 
(This is not uploaded due to privacy concerns. However, if you need it for research purpose, please contact sailin.zhong@unifr.ch to discuss on it.) 
* The videos created for the user study, in two format: with post-processed audio or mono audio
* The video used for the auditive test at the beginning of the user study

## Folder 3 : The surveys
* One of the surveys (as an example) used for the user study of the thesis. 

## Folder 4 : Analysis

* In the folder [statistical tests] containing the statistical analysis code (R code only, the SPSS part is not included) and summary of results.

* In the folder [eyetracking data]: example data (from dialog 1) recorded on realeye.io

* In the folder [eyetracking analysis]: all the files needed for the analysis of the eyetracking data. 
  - [Eye-tracking analysis - Extract fixations]: code to adjust raw fixation data (recorded on realeye.io) with respect to the coordination of video image size. 
  - [Eye-tracking - Analysis.ipynb]: code for the eye-tracking metrics calculation and (visual) analysis
  - [Individual differences analysis.ipynb]: code for preparing consolidated data (from tests, subjective ratings, and eye-tracking metrics) for statistical analysis (in R), preparing data for mHMM model (in R) and calculating the ratio of states (resulted from mHMM model in R).   
* In the folder [mHMM]: R code for the analysis of individual differences using multilevel HMM (mHMM). 
  - [mHMM.R]: mHMM for binaural conditions (x4)
  - [mHMM_mono.R]: mHMM for mono conditions (x2)
